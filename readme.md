## Contract working 

### Initialization   
The init_module function sets up the vault. It creates a resource account, which acts as the vault's "bank account." This account can hold and transfer tokens, but it's controlled by the smart contract logic, not by a user with a private key.

### Depositing Tokens
Only the admin can deposit tokens into the vault. This increases the total balance of the vault.

### Allocating Tokens
The admin can allocate tokens to specific addresses. This doesn't transfer tokens, but rather reserves them for future claims. It's like putting a label on some of the tokens saying "reserved for Alice."

### Claiming Tokens
When a user claims their tokens, the contract checks if they have an allocation, and if so, transfers the tokens to them. This is like going to the bank and withdrawing money that was set aside for you.

### Withdrawing Tokens
The admin can withdraw any tokens that haven't been allocated. This ensures that only truly "free" tokens can be withdrawn.

### Security Measures
Access Control: Many functions can only be called by the admin.
Balance Checks: The contract ensures it never tries to transfer more tokens than it has.   
Allocation Tracking: The contract carefully tracks allocated vs. unallocated tokens.    
This vault contract provides a flexible system for managing token distributions. It allows for controlled deposit, allocation, and withdrawal of tokens, with clear access controls and event logging.


## Affect of Presence of transfer_ownership function
Due to presence of a function that allows the admin to transfer ownership of the vault to a new admin address, the security of the contract may be severely affected due to the following reasons :

1) Contract access may be arbitrarily transfered 
2) Any mistake in transferring may cause the wrong person to get the ownership
3) The person who got the ownership may not have full understanding of the contract and its features, etc.
